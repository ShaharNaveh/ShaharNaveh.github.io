This guide will help you navigate the initial steps, from selecting a project that aligns with your interests to successfully submitting your first pull request, ensuring you can confidently engage with the open source ecosystem.


## Getting Started

### Creating an Account on a Git Hosting Platform

While there are many git hosting platforms such as [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/), and [Github](https://github.com/), Github is the leading platform for hosting most open-source projects.

[Create a Github account](https://github.com/signup) and proceed to the next step.

### Configuring Git

While there are many GUI based programs, I would recommend using the CLI as it will help to better understand what goes on behind the scenes.
