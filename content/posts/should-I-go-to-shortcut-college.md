## Should I?
**The short answer is no, don't.**

You're probably seeing this post because you asked something like:

> Do you guys recommend \<SHORTCUT COLLEGE\> for \<JOB ROLE\>?

and someone linked this post as an answer.

## What Are Shortcut-Colleges?
Shortcut-colleges offer a condensed, hands-on approach to tech education, promising quick entry into the workforce with highly priced programs.

Their marketing slogan is:

> Get our course, and land yourself your dream job.

But the truth is, there's no magic bullet that guarantees success.

## Why Not?
Your goal is probably to get a high paying job with good working conditions and high-tech positions do offer that.

But as this blog post will explain, shortcut-colleges can't give you what you're really after ðŸ˜®

## But My Contract With Them Requires Them To Get Me A Job
Some shortcut-colleges are promising an entry-level position upon course completion, with the sweet benefits of getting:

- Extremely underpaid
- Exploited
- No promises of not getting fired after a month

There are a lot of fine-print you need to lookout for such as:

- They are only responsible for getting you a job interview, not an actual offer 
- They are doing their side by giving you an offer, if you don't sign it. It's on you

And there are much, much more...

Not so fun to spend your life savings for a certification that's better used as a toilet paper.
