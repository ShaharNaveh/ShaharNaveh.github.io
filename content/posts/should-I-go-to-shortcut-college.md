> Do you guys recommend \<SHORTCUT COLLEGE\> for \<JOB ROLE\>?

and someone linked this post as an answer.

## What Are Shortcut-Colleges?
Shortcut-colleges offer a condensed, hands-on approach to tech education, promising quick entry into the workforce with highly priced programs.

## Why Not?
Your goal is probably to get a high paying job with good working condition, and high-tech positions do offer that.

But, those shortcut-colleges can't provide you that luxury lifestyle that you are after ðŸ˜² for reasons I'm going to layout in this post.

> Get our course, and land yourself your dream job.

Is usually the marketing slogan for these courses.
The truth is, there's no magic bullet that guarantees success.

### But My Contract With Them Requires Them To Get Me A Job

Some shortcut-colleges are promising an entry-level position upon course completion, with the sweet benefits of getting:

- Extremely underpaid
- Exploited


saying that 100% of it's students are in the workforce.
