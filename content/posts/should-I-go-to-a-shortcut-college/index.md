## Why Not?
Your goal is probably getting a high paying job with good working conditions and high-tech positions do offer that, but as this blog post will explain, shortcut-colleges can't give you what you're really after ðŸ˜®

### You Need To Study On Your Own
Success in tech requires continuous self-learning and adaptability. No single course can provide all the knowledge you need for a sustainable career.

### Shallow Skillset
Tech involves more than just coding; it requires problem-solving, creativity, and adaptability. Shortcut colleges often focus narrowly on specific tools, neglecting broader essential skills.

## FAQ
### But I Got A Scholarship
These are marketing tactics. They inflate prices and offer discounts to create a false sense of value.

### But It's Hard For Me To Study On My Own
Self-discipline and motivation are essential in tech. If you struggle with independent learning, reconsider your career path.

### But My Contract Guarantees A Job
Some shortcut-colleges are promising an entry-level position upon course completion, with the sweet benefits of getting:

- Extremely underpaid
- Exploited
- No promises of not getting fired after a month

There are a lot of fine-print you need to lookout for such as:

- They are only responsible for getting you a job interview, not an actual offer 
- They are doing their side by giving you an offer, if you don't sign it. It's on you

Not so fun to spending your life savings for a certification that's better used as toilet paper.
